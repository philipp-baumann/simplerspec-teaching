	abstract = {Historically, our understanding of the soil and assessment of its quality and function has been gained through routine soil chemical and physical laboratory analysis. There is a global thrust towards the development of more time- and cost-efficient methodologies for soil analysis as there is a great demand for larger amounts of good quality, inexpensive soil data to be used in environmental monitoring, modelling and precision agriculture. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy provides a good alternative that may be used to enhance or replace conventional methods of soil analysis, as it overcomes some of their limitations. Spectroscopy is rapid, timely, less expensive, non-destructive, straightforward and sometimes more accurate than conventional analysis. Furthermore, a single spectrum allows for simultaneous characterisation of various soil properties and the techniques are adaptable for ‘on-the-go’ field use. The aims of this paper are threefold: (i) determine the value of qualitative analysis in the visible (VIS) (400–700 nm), near infrared (NIR) (700–2500 nm) and mid infrared (MIR) (2500–25,000 nm); (ii) compare the simultaneous predictions of a number of different soil properties in each of these regions and the combined VIS–NIR–MIR to determine whether the combined information produces better predictions of soil properties than each of the individual regions; and (iii) deduce which of these regions may be best suited for simultaneous analysis of various soil properties. In this instance we implemented partial least-squares regression (PLSR) to construct calibration models, which were independently validated for the prediction of various soil properties from the soil spectra. The soil properties examined were soil pHCa, pHw, lime requirement (LR), organic carbon (OC), clay, silt, sand, cation exchange capacity (CEC), exchangeable calcium (Ca), exchangeable aluminium (Al), nitrate–nitrogen (NO3–N), available phosphorus (PCol), exchangeable potassium (K) and electrical conductivity (EC). Our results demonstrated the value of qualitative soil interpretations using the loading weight vectors from the PLSR decomposition. The MIR was more suitable than the VIS or NIR for this type of analysis due to the higher incidence spectral bands in this region as well as the higher intensity and specificity of the signal. Quantitatively, the accuracy of PLSR predictions in each of the VIS, NIR, MIR and VIS–NIR–MIR spectral regions varied considerably amongst properties. However, more accurate predictions were obtained using the MIR for pH, LR, OC, CEC, clay, silt and sand contents, P and EC. The NIR produced more accurate predictions for exchangeable Al and K than any of the ranges. There were only minor improvements in predictions of clay, silt and sand content using the combined VIS–NIR–MIR range. This work demonstrates the potential of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy using the VIS, NIR and MIR for more efficient soil analysis and the acquisition of soil information.},

	abstract = {The soil science community is facing a growing demand of regional, continental, and worldwide databases in order to monitor the status of the soil. However, the availability of such data is very scarce. Cost-effective tools to measure soil properties for large areas (e.g., Europe) are required. Soil spectroscopy has shown to be a fast, cost-effective, environmental-friendly, nondestructive, reproducible, and repeatable analytical technique. The main aim of this paper is to describe the state of the art of soil spectroscopy as well as its potential to facilitating soil monitoring. The factors constraining the application of soil spectroscopy as an alternative to traditional laboratory analyses, together with the limits of the technique, are addressed. The paper also highlights that the widespread use of spectroscopy to monitor the status of the soil should be encouraged by (1) the creation of a standard for the collection of laboratory soil spectra, to promote the sharing of spectral libraries, and (2) the scanning of existing soil archives, reducing the need for costly sampling campaigns. Finally, routine soil analysis using soil spectroscopy would be beneficial for the end users by a reduction in analytical costs, and an increased comparability of results between laboratories. This ambitious project will materialize only through (1) the establishment of local and regional partnerships among existent institutions able to generate the necessary technical competence, and (2) the support of international organizations. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of United Nations and the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission are well placed to promote the use of laboratory and field spectrometers for monitoring the state of soils.},

	abstract = {PLS-regression (PLSR) is the PLS approach in its simplest, and in chemistry and technology, most used form (two-block predictive PLS). PLSR is a method for relating two data matrices, X and Y, by a linear multivariate model, but goes beyond traditional regression in that it models also the structure of X and Y. PLSR derives its usefulness from its ability to analyze data with many, noisy, collinear, and even incomplete variables in both X and Y. PLSR has the desirable property that the precision of the model parameters improves with the increasing number of relevant variables and observations.

This article reviews PLSR as it has developed to become a standard tool in chemometrics and used in chemistry and engineering. The underlying model and its assumptions are discussed, and commonly used diagnostics are reviewed together with the interpretation of resulting parameters.

Two examples are used as illustrations: First, a Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship (QSAR)/Quantitative Structure–Property Relationship (QSPR) data set of peptides is used to outline how to develop, interpret and refine a PLSR model. Second, a data set from the manufacturing of recycled paper is analyzed to illustrate time series modelling of process data by means of PLSR and time-lagged X-variables.},

	abstract = {Soil fertility depletion in smallholder agricultural systems in sub-Saharan Africa presents a formidable challenge both for food production and environmental sustainability. A critical constraint to managing soils in sub-Saharan Africa is poor targeting of soil management interventions. This is partly due to lack of diagnostic tools for screening soil condition that would lead to a robust and repeatable spatially explicit case definition of poor soil condition. The objectives of this study were to: (i) evaluate the ability of near infrared spectroscopy to detect changes in soil properties across a forest-cropland chronosequence; and (ii) develop a heuristic scheme for the application of infrared spectroscopy as a tool for case definition and diagnostic screening of soil condition for agricultural and environmental management. Soil reflectance was measured for 582 topsoil samples collected from forest-cropland chronosequence age classes namely; forest, recently converted, RC (17 years) and historically converted, HC (ca.70 years). 130 randomly selected samples were used to calibrate soil properties to soil reflectance using partial least-squares regression (PLSR). 64 randomly selected samples were withheld for validation. A proportional odds logistic model was applied to chronosequence age classes and 10 principal components of spectral reflectance to determine three soil condition classes namely; “good”, “average” and “poor” for 194 samples. Discriminant analysis was applied to classify the remaining 388 “unknown” samples into soil condition classes using the 194 samples as a training set. Validation r2 values were: total C, 0.91; total N, 0.90; effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC), 0.90; exchangeable Ca, 0.85; clay content, 0.77; silt content, 0.77 exchangeable Mg, 0.76; soil pH, 0.72; and K, 0.64. A spectral based definition of “good”, “average” and “poor” soil condition classes provided a basis for an explicitly quantitative case definition of poor or degraded soils. Estimates of probabilities of membership of a sample in a spectral soil condition class presents an approach for probabilistic risk-based assessments of soil condition over large spatial scales. The study concludes that reflectance spectroscopy is rapid and offers the possibility for major efficiency and cost saving, permitting spectral case definition to define poor or degraded soils, leading to better targeting of management interventions.},
